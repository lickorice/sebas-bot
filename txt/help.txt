These are the following **commands** that I am to listen for:

`..verifyme` in the ***appropriate verification channel***  **allows me to verify you** if you still haven't a **Member** role.

**Member commands:**
`..help` **displays a list commands** that I can do.
`..info` **shows my information** as a bot.
`..add (a) (b)` **adds** two numbers.
`..multiply (a) (b)` **multiplies** two numbers.
`..divide (a) (b)` **divides** the first number by the second number.
`..subtract (a) (b)` **subtracts** the first number by the second number.
`..react (str/set) (message/set)` **calls my successive reaction algorithm.**
`..rhelp` **helps you with** `..react`

**Moderator commands:**
`..verifyuser @mention` **sends a verification message** to the user given that they still do not carry a **Member** role.

**Admin commands:**
`..leave` **Shuts me down.**
`..dmall "msg"` **Sends a Direct Message to everyone.** Message should be in quotes to work.
`..consolidateroles` **Consolidates mod and admin roles** to the database just in case there was a change of roles.
`..setvrfchannel` **Sets the current channel as a verification channel**, but there may only be ***one*** such channel.
`..rmvrfchannel` **Unassigns the current channel as a verification channel.**
`..verifyall` **Mass-verifies everyone in the server** who is not a **Member**

Any suggestions for me is greatly appreciated at `#bot-suggestions` :D
